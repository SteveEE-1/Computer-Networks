# OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model

The **OSI model** is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or networking system into **seven layers**. Each layer serves a distinct purpose and communicates with the layers directly above and below it.

---

## **1. Physical Layer**
The **Physical Layer** is responsible for the **transmission of raw bits (1’s and 0’s)** over a physical medium. It defines **hardware specifications** such as cables, connectors, signal types, and transmission rates.

- **Key Functions:**
  - Defines electrical, optical, or radio signals.
  - Specifies pin layouts, voltage levels, and timing.
  - Ensures bit-level transmission between devices.

- **Examples:**
  - **Ethernet cables (Twisted Pair)**
  - **Coaxial cables**
  - **Fiber optics**
  - **Wireless transmission (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)**
  - **Repeaters**

## **2. Data Link Layer** (Hop-to-Hop)
The **Data Link Layer** provides **node-to-node communication** and handles **framing, error detection, and MAC addressing**. It ensures that data frames are reliably transferred between two directly connected devices.

- **Key Functions:**
  - Uses **MAC addresses** for device identification.
  - Performs **error detection** (e.g., CRC).
  - Controls data flow between devices.
  - Organizes data into **frames**.

- **Examples:**
  - **Switches**
  - **Network Interface Cards (NICs)** (MAC addresses are embedded here)
  - **Bridges**

## **3. Network Layer** (End-to-End)
The **Network Layer** is responsible for **logical addressing (IP addresses)** and **routing**. It ensures that data packets are delivered from the source device to the destination device across multiple networks.

- **Key Functions:**
  - Assigns **IP addresses** (IPv4: `0.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`, IPv6 available as well).
  - Determines the **best route** using routers.
  - Encapsulates data into **packets**.

- **Examples:**
  - **Routers**
  - **Layer 3 switches**
  - **Hosts (end devices)**

## **4. Transport Layer** (Service-to-Service)
The **Transport Layer** ensures **reliable or efficient delivery** of data between applications on two devices. It uses **port numbers** to differentiate services.

- **Key Functions:**
  - Segmentation and reassembly of data.
  - Error recovery and flow control.
  - Identifies services using **port numbers**.
  - Protocol choice determines reliability vs. speed.

- **Common Protocols:**
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – Reliable, connection-oriented.
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** – Faster, connectionless.

- **Examples:**
  - Servers listening on standard ports (e.g., HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443).
  - Client devices using random **ephemeral ports** for connections.

## **5. Application Layer**
The **Application Layer** is the closest to the end user and provides **interfaces for network services**. It interacts with software applications to implement communication.

- **Key Functions:**
  - Enables application-specific communication (e.g., email, browsing).
  - Defines protocols for data representation and exchange.

- **Examples:**
  - **HTTP / HTTPS** (Web browsing)
  - **FTP / SFTP** (File transfer)
  - **SMTP / IMAP / POP3** (Email)
  - **DNS** (Domain name resolution)

## **🔍 Summary Table**
| Layer | Responsibility | Key Address | Examples |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **1. Physical** | Transmission of bits | N/A | Ethernet, Fiber, Wi-Fi |
| **2. Data Link** | Hop-to-hop delivery | MAC Address | Switch, NIC |
| **3. Network** | End-to-end delivery | IP Address | Router |
| **4. Transport** | Service-to-service | Port Number | TCP, UDP |
| **7. Application** | User interaction | Application Protocols | HTTP, FTP, DNS |

> 💡 **Remember:**  
> OSI layers work together—each layer focuses on specific tasks, but they operate in combination to ensure smooth and reliable communication across networks.
